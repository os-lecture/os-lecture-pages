   - **Batch processing (batch)**

LibOS target
- Keep applications isolated from hardware
- Simplifies the difficulty and complexity of applications accessing hardware
  
![bg right:35% 95%](figs/batch-os.png)

---
#### Experiment Requirements
- Understand software that runs other software
- Understand privilege level and privilege level switching
- Understand system calls
- Can write ``Deng Shiyu`` batch operating system

---
#### General Idea
- Compilation: Application and kernel **compiled independently**, merged into one image
- Construction: system call service request interface, application **management and initialization**
- Run: OS **executes applications** one by one
- Running: the application issues a **system call** request, and the OS completes the system call
- Run: **Privilege level switching** between application and OS based on hardware privilege level mechanism



---
#### History background
- GM-NAA I/O System(1956)
   - Inspiration: Automobile production line
- MULTICS OS (1969, MIT/GE/AT&T)
   - GE 645 has a guard ring with level 8 hardware support

#### Separate the application from the underlying support library

```
└── user (application and underlying support library)

```

---
#### import external library
```rust
   #[macro_use]
   extern crate user_lib;
```

---
#### Design support library

In lib.rs we define the entry point _start for the user library:
```rust
#[no_mangle]
#[link_section = ".text.entry"]
pub extern "C" fn _start() -> ! {
     clear_bss();
     exit(main());
     panic!("unreachable after sys_exit!");
}
```

#### Application memory layout

![bg 70%](figs/memlayout.png)

---
<style scoped>
{
  font-size: 31px
}
</style>
#### Design support library
`user/src/linker.ld`

- Adjust the starting physical address of the program to 0x80400000, and the application program will be loaded to run on this physical address;
- Put the .text.entry where _start is located at the beginning of the entire program, that is to say, as long as the batch processing system jumps to 0x80400000 after loading, it has entered the entry point of the user library and will jump to the application after initialization Program main logic;
- Provides the start and end addresses of the .bss section of the final executable file, which is convenient for the clear_bss function to use.

The rest is the same as before

#### System call execution flow of the application

![w:1050](figs/EnvironmentCallFlow.png)

---

#### System call execution flow of the application

- In the submodule syscall, the application calls the interface provided by the batch system through ecall
- The ``ecall`` command triggers an exception named Environment call from U-mode
- Trap enters the S mode to execute the service code specially provided by the batch processing system for this exception
- a0~a6 save the parameters of the system call, a0 saves the return value, and a7 is used to pass the syscall ID
---
#### System call support library
```rust--
/// Function: Write the data in the buffer in the memory to the file.
/// Parameter: `fd` indicates the file descriptor to be written to the file;
/// `buf` indicates the starting address of the buffer in memory;
/// `len` indicates the length of the buffer in memory.
/// Return value: Returns the length of the successful write.
/// syscall ID: 64
fn sys_write(fd: usize, buf: *const u8, len: usize) -> isize;

/// Function: Exit the application and inform the batch system of the return value.
/// Parameter: `xstate` represents the return value of the application.
/// Return value: This system call should not return.
/// syscall ID: 93
fn sys_exit(xstate: usize) -> !;
```


---
#### System call parameter passing

```rust
fn syscall(id: usize, args: [usize; 3]) -> isize {
     let mut ret: isize;
     unsafe {
         asm!(
             "ecall",
             inlateout("x10") args[0] => ret, //first parameter & return value
             in("x11") args[1], //the second parameter
             in("x12") args[2], //the third parameter
             in("x17") id //syscall number
         );
     }
     ret //return value
}
```


---
#### System call encapsulation
```rust
const SYSCALL_WRITE: usize = 64;
const SYSCALL_EXIT: usize = 93;
// Encapsulation of system calls
pub fn sys_write(fd: usize, buffer: &[u8]) -> isize {
     syscall(SYSCALL_WRITE, [fd, buffer.as_ptr() as usize, buffer.len()])
}
pub fn sys_exit(xstate: i32) -> isize {
     syscall(SYSCALL_EXIT, [xstate as usize, 0, 0])
}
```

---
#### System call encapsulation
```rust
pub fn write(fd: usize, buf: &[u8]) -> isize { sys_write(fd, buf) }

const STDOUT: usize = 1;

impl Write for Stdout {
     fn write_str(&mut self, s: &str) -> fmt::Result {
         write(STDOUT, s.as_bytes());
         Ok(())
     }
}

#### Link the application image to the kernel

     .section .data
     .global_num_app
_num_app:
     .quad 5

---
#### Application Management Data Structures

```rust
// os/src/batch.rs

struct AppManager {
     num_app: usize,
     current_app: usize,
     app_start: [usize; MAX_APP_NUM + 1],
}
```


---
#### Find the application binary
- Locate the symbol _num_app provided in link_app.S
```rust
lazy_static! {
     static ref APP_MANAGER: UPSafeCell<AppManager> = unsafe { UPSafeCell::new({
         extern "C" { fn _num_app(); }
         let num_app_ptr = _num_app as usize as *const usize;
         ...
         app_start[..=num_app].copy_from_slice(app_start_raw);
         AppManager {
             num_app,
             current_app: 0,
             app_start,
         }
```

---

#### Load the application binary
```rust
unsafe fn load_app(&self, app_id: usize) {
     // clear icache
     asm!("fence.i");
     // clear app area
     ...
     let app_src = core::slice::from_raw_parts(
         self.app_start[app_id] as *const u8,
         self.app_start[app_id + 1] - self.app_start[app_id] );
     let app_dst = core::slice::from_raw_parts_mut(
         APP_BASE_ADDRESS as *mut u8,
         app_src.len());
     app_dst.copy_from_slice(app_src);
}
```


---
#### Load the application binary

- fence.i : used to clear i-cache

Note: ``fence.i`` is an i-cache barrier (barrier) instruction, a non-privileged instruction, which belongs to the "Zifencei" extended specification

**Why?**

---
#### Load the application binary

- fence.i : used to clear i-cache

- The cache made by the CPU for physical memory is divided into d-cache and i-cache
- The OS will modify the memory area that will be fetched by the CPU, which will make the i-cache contain inconsistent content with the memory
- The OS here must use the fence.i command to manually clear the i-cache to invalidate all the contents in it, so as to ensure the correctness of the CPU's access to memory data and codes.

#### Privilege level switching related CSR
| CSR name | Trap-related function of this CSR |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- ------------------- |
| sstatus | `SPP` and other fields give the privilege level (S/U) of the CPU before the Trap occurs |
| sepc | Record the address of the last instruction executed before the Trap occurred |
|scause | Describes the reason for the Trap |
| stval | Give additional information about Trap |
| stvec | Control the entry address of the Trap processing code |

---
#### Hardware logic after privilege level switching

1. The SPP field of sstatus will be modified to the current privilege level of the CPU (U/S);
2. sepc will be modified to the address of the next instruction that will be executed by default after the Trap processing is completed;
3. Scause/stval will be modified to the reason of this Trap and relevant additional information;
4. The CPU sets the current privilege level to S, and jumps to the Trap processing entry address set by stvec.



---
#### Privilege level switching and user stack and kernel stack
Why use two different stacks?

safe safe safe

```rust
const USER_STACK_SIZE: usize = 4096 * 2;
const KERNEL_STACK_SIZE: usize = 4096 * 2;

static KERNEL_STACK: KernelStack = KernelStack { data: [0; KERNEL_STACK_SIZE] };
static USER_STACK: UserStack = UserStack { data: [0; USER_STACK_SIZE] };
```

---
#### Switch stack in privilege level switch
```rust
impl UserStack {
     fn get_sp(&self) -> usize {
         self.data.as_ptr() as usize + USER_STACK_SIZE
     }
}
RegSP = USER_STACK. get_sp();
RegSP = KERNEL_STACK.get_sp();
```

---

#### Trap context data structure
```rust
#[repr(C)]
pub struct TrapContext {
     pub x: [usize; 32],
     pub sstatus: Sstatus,
     pub sepc: usize,
}
```
- Application/kernel control flow runs at different privilege levels for general-purpose registers
- When entering Trap, the hardware will immediately overwrite scause/stval/sstatus/sepc


---
#### Trap entry point after privilege level switching
```rust
pub fn init() {
     extern "C" { fn __alltraps(); }
     unsafe {
         stvec::write(__alltraps as usize, TrapMode::Direct);
     }
}
```


---
#### Trap context processing during system calls
1. When the application enters the kernel state through ecall, the operating system saves the Trap context of the interrupted application;

![bg right:40% 100%](figs/kernel-stack.png)


---
#### Trap context processing during system calls

2. The operating system completes the distribution and processing of the system call service according to the contents of the Trap-related CSR register;

![bg right:40% 100%](figs/kernel-stack.png)


---
#### Trap context processing during system calls

3. After the operating system completes the system call service, it needs to restore the Trap context of the interrupted application program, and let the application program continue to execute through the ``sret`` instruction.
![bg right:40% 100%](figs/kernel-stack.png)
---

#### Switch from user stack to kernel stack
**sscratch CSR** important transit register

When the privilege level is switched, we need to save the Trap context on the kernel stack, so we need a register to temporarily store the kernel stack address, and use it as the base address pointer to sequentially save the contents of the Trap context.

But all general-purpose registers cannot be used as base address pointers, because they all need to be saved, and if they are overwritten, it will affect the execution of subsequent application control flow.

---
#### Switch from user stack to kernel stack

**sscratch CSR** important transit register

- Temporarily save the address of the kernel stack
- As a transfer station, the value of sp (currently pointing to the address of the user stack) can be temporarily saved in sscratch
- Only need one `csrrw sp, sscratch, sp // swap the two register contents of sp and sscratch`
- Complete the switching of user stack --> kernel stack

---

#### Save the general-purpose registers in the Trap context

Macros to save general-purpose registers
```
# os/src/trap/trap.S
.macro SAVE_GP n
     sd x\n, \n*8(sp)
.endm
```

6. Kernel programming
- Application management and loading
- Privilege level switching
- Trap context
- **Trap processing flow**
- execute the application

---

#### Trap processing flow


The overall flow of Trap processing is as follows:
1. First save the Trap context on the kernel stack through __alltraps;
2. Then jump to the trap_handler function to complete trap distribution and processing.
```
__alltraps:
     csrrw sp, sscratch, sp
     # now sp->kernel stack, sscratch->user stack

     # allocate a TrapContext on kernel stack
     addi sp, sp, -34*8
```



---
#### Save Trap context
save general purpose registers
```
     # save general-purpose registers
     sd x1, 1*8(sp)
     # skip sp(x2), we will save it later
     sd x3, 3*8(sp)
     # skip tp(x4), application does not use it
     # save x5~x31
     .set n, 5
     .rept 27
         SAVE_GP %n
         .set n, n+1
     .endr
```


---
#### Save Trap context
save sstatus and sepc
```
     # we can use t0/t1/t2 freely, because they were saved on kernel stack
     csrr t0, sstatus
     csrr t1, sepc
     sd t0, 32*8(sp)
     sd t1, 33*8(sp)
```

---
#### Save Trap context
Save user SP
```
     # read user stack from sscratch and save it on the kernel stack
     csrr t2, sscratch
     sd t2, 2*8(sp)
```
```rust
pub struct TrapContext {
     pub x: [usize; 32],
     pub sstatus: Sstatus,
     pub sepc: usize,
}
```
---

#### Call trap_handler
```
     # set input argument of trap_handler(cx: &mut TrapContext)
     mv a0, sp
     call trap_handler
```

Let the register a0 point to the stack pointer of the kernel stack, which is the address of the Trap context we just saved. This is because we will call trap_handler for Trap processing next, and its first parameter cx is obtained from a0 by the calling specification.

---
#### Restore Trap context
1. Most of them are reverse operations of saving registers;
2. The last step is ``sret`` instruction //return from kernel mode to user mode

Note: "Restore Trap Context" will be explained in more detail when "Executing Program" is explained later


---
#### trap_handler处理syscall

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub fn trap_handler(cx: &mut TrapContext) -> &mut TrapContext {
    let scause = scause::read();
    let stval = stval::read();
    match scause.cause() {
        Trap::Exception(Exception::UserEnvCall) => {
            cx.sepc += 4;
            cx.x[10] = syscall(cx.x[17], [cx.x[10], cx.x[11], cx.x[12]]) as usize;
        }
    ...
    }

}
```

---

#### Execution timing of the application
- When the batch OS initialization is complete
- An application terminated or an error occurred

---

#### Let the application execute
Switch from kernel mode to user mode
- Ready to apply the context ``Trap Context``
- Restore application related registers
- especially application user stack pointer and execution address
- **Return to user mode to let the application execute**

![bg right:35% 100%](figs/kernel-stack.png)

---

#### Return to the user state for the application to execute

- Switch from kernel mode to user mode
   - **hardware logic** of ``sret`` instruction:
      - Response to interrupts/exceptions
      - CPU Mode from S-Mode back to U-Mode
      - ``pc`` <-- ``spec`` CSR
      - keep running

#### Switch to the next application

Call the run_next_app function to switch to the next application:
- Construct the Trap context needed for the application to start executing;
- Through the `__restore` function, from the newly constructed Trap context, restore part of the registers executed by the application;
- Set the content of the `sepc` CSR to the application entry point `0x80400000`;
- switch `scratch` and `sp` registers, set `sp` to point to the application user stack;
- Execute `sret` to switch from S privilege level to U privilege level.


---
#### Construct Trap context
```rust
impl TrapContext {
     pub fn set_sp(&mut self, sp: usize) { self. x[2] = sp; }
     pub fn app_init_context(entry: usize, sp: usize) -> Self {
         let mut sstatus = sstatus::read();
         sstatus.set_spp(SPP::User);
         let mut cx = Self {
             x: [0; 32],
             sstatus,
             sepc: entry,
         };
         cx.set_sp(sp);
         cx
```


---
#### Run the next program
```rust
ub fn run_next_app() -> ! {
     ...
     unsafe {
         app_manager.load_app(current_app);
     }
     ...
     unsafe {
         __restore(KERNEL_STACK.push_context(
             TrapContext::app_init_context(APP_BASE_ADDRESS, USER_STACK.get_sp())
         ) as *const _ as usize);
     }
     panic!("Unreachable in batch::run_current_app!");
}
```

---
#### Run the next program
```
__restore:
     # case1: start running app by __restore
     # case2: back to U after handling trap
     mv sp, a0
     # now sp->kernel stack(after allocated), sscratch->user stack
     # restore sstatus/sepc
     ld t0, 32*8(sp)
     ld t1, 33*8(sp)
     ld t2, 2*8(sp)
     csrw sstatus, t0
     csrw sepc, t1
     csrw sscratch, t2
```


---
#### Run the next program

```
# restore general-purpuse registers except sp/tp
     ld x1, 1*8(sp)
     ld x3, 3*8(sp)
     .set n, 5
     .rept 27
         LOAD_GP %n
         .set n, n+1
     .endr
     # release TrapContext on kernel stack
     addi sp, sp, 34*8
     # now sp->kernel stack, sscratch->user stack
     csrrw sp, sscratch, sp
     sret
```

#### Ask a question

  When is sscratch set to the top of the kernel stack?
