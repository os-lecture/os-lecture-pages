# Preliminary knowledge

### Programming Languages (Assembly, C, and Rust)
  - :( not a development app
  - :) Instead develop system programs

### Data structure
  - :) Just understand the basic data structure

### Principles of computer composition
  - :( Mr. Liu/Mr. Kang's RISC-V principle
  - :) Patterson's RISC-V Principles

### Compilation principle
  - :) It doesn't matter if you haven't learned it, :( But you still need to know the high-level language <â€“>RISC-V assembly language
