### Practice: SMOS
History background
- Around 1963, when the mathematician Edsger Dijkstra and his team were developing an operating system (THE multiprogramming system) for the Electrologica X8 computer, they proposed that the signal (Semaphore) is a variable or abstract data type, Used to control access to common resources by multiple threads.
- Brinch Hansen (1973) and Hoare (1974) combined the operating system and the Concurrent Pascal programming language to propose a high-level synchronization primitive called a monitor. A monitor is a collection of procedures (procedures, Pascal term, function), shared variables, etc. A thread can call a procedure in a monitor.

### Practical steps
For example, an application that implements the philosopher's problem shows the process of 5 philosophers thinking/eating/resting with 5 forks.
```
Rust user shell

time cost = 7271
'-' -> THINKING; 'x' -> EATING; ' ' -> WAITING
#0: -------xxxxxxxx----------xxxx-----xxxxxx--xxx
#1: ---xxxxxx--xxxxxx-------- x---xxxxxx

### Practical steps
Multi-threaded application `race_adder.rs` for global variable accumulation problem
```
A //global variable
A=A+1 //Multiple threads accumulate A
```
Multiple threads execute the above code, will there really be a Race Condition (competition condition)?

- Concurrent and disordered threads use limited, exclusive, and non-preemptive resources to create conflicts called competition (Race)
- Multiple threads compete out of order for resources that cannot be accessed at the same time, and execution errors occur, which is called a race condition (Race Condition)

---
### Practical steps
Multi-threaded application `race_adder.rs` for global variable accumulation problem
```rust
pub fn main() -> i32 {
     let start = get_time();
     let mut v = Vec::new();
     for _ in 0..THREAD_COUNT {
         v.push(thread_create(f as usize, 0) as usize); // f function is the thread body
     }
     let mut time_cost = Vec::new();
     for tid in v. iter() {
         time_cost.push(waittid(*tid));
     }
     println!("time cost is {}ms", get_time() - start);
     assert_eq!(unsafe { A }, PER_THREAD * THREAD_COUNT); //Compare the accumulated value A
     0
}
```


---
### Practical steps
Multi-threaded application `race_adder.rs` for global variable accumulation problem
```rust
unsafe fn f() -> ! {
     let mut t = 2usize;
     for _ in 0..PER_THREAD {
         let a = &mut A as *mut usize; // "slow execution" A=A+1
         let cur = a.read_volatile(); // "slow execution" A=A+1
         for _ in 0..500 { t = t * t % 10007; } // increase switching probability
         a.write_volatile(cur + 1); // "slow execution" A=A+1
     }
     exit(t as i32)
}
```
---
### Practical steps
Multi-threaded application `race_adder.rs` for global variable accumulation problem
```
>> race_adder
time cost is 31ms
Panicked at src/bin/race_adder.rs:40, assertion failed: `(left == right)`
   left: `15788`,
  right: `16000`
[kernel] Aborted, SIGABRT=6
```
Race Condition will appear every time it is executed!


---
### Practical steps
Multi-thread application `race_adder_atomic.rs` for global variable accumulation problem based on atomic operation
```rust
unsafe fn f() -> ! {
     for _ in 0..PER_THREAD {
         while OCCUPIED
             .compare_exchange(false, true, Ordering::Relaxed, Ordering::Relaxed)
             .is_err() { yield_(); } // Approximate spin lock operation based on CAS operation
         let a = &mut A as *mut usize; // "slow execution" A=A+1
         let cur = a.read_volatile(); // "slow execution" A=A+1
         for _ in 0..500 { t = t * t % 10007; } // increase switching probability
         a.write_volatile(cur + 1); // "slow execution" A=A+1
         OCCUPIED.store(false, Ordering::Relaxed); // unlock operation
     }
     ...
```
---
### Practical steps
Multi-thread application `race_adder_atomic.rs` for global variable accumulation problem based on atomic operation

```
>> race_adder_atomic
time cost is 29ms
>> race_adder_loop
```
As you can see, the execution is fast and correct.

---
### Practical steps
Mutex-based multithreaded application `race_adder_mutex_[spin|block]`
```rust
unsafe fn f() -> ! {
     let mut t = 2usize;
     for _ in 0..PER_THREAD {
         mutex_lock(0); //lock(id)
         let a = &mut A as *mut usize; // "slow execution" A=A+1
         let cur = a.read_volatile(); // "slow execution" A=A+1
         for _ in 0..500 { t = t * t % 10007; } // increase switching probability
         a.write_volatile(cur + 1); // "slow execution" A=A+1
         mutex_unlock(0); //unlock(id)
     }
     exit(t as i32)
}
```
---
### Practical steps
Multi-thread application `race_adder_mutex_spin` based on mutex-based global variable accumulation problem
```
>> race_adder_mutex_spin
time cost is 249ms
# Execute system calls, and perform fetch/insert/wait operations on the ready queue
```

Multi-thread application `race_adder_mutex_block` for global variable accumulation problem based on mutex
```
>> race_adder_mutex_blocking
time cost is 919ms
# Execute system calls, and perform fetch/insert/wait operations on the ready queue + waiting queue
```

###  Programming
The core data structure of spin mutex and block mutex: `UPSafeCell`
```rust
pub struct UPSafeCell<T> { // Allow safe use of mutable global variables on a single core

impl<T> UPSafeCell<T> {
     pub unsafe fn new(value: T) -> Self {
         Self { inner: RefCell::new(value) }
     }

     }
}
```

---

                 suspend_current_and_run_next(); //put the current thread at the end of the ready queue
                 continue;
             } else {
                 *locked = true; //Get the lock, you can continue to execute in the critical section
                 return;
         ...
  ```


---
###  Programming
Related functions of block mutex
```rust
impl Mutex for MutexBlocking {
     fn lock(&self) {
         let mut mutex_inner = self.inner.exclusive_access(); //Exclusive access to mutex_inner
         if mutex_inner. locked {
             //Put the current thread in the waiting queue related to this lock

             block_current_and_run_next();
         } else {
             mutex_inner.locked = true; //Get the lock, you can continue to execute in the critical section

     fn unlock(&self) {
         let mut mutex_inner = self. inner. exclusive_access();
         assert!(mutex_inner.locked);

             add_task(waking_task);
         } else {
             mutex_inner.locked = false; //release the lock
         }
     }
```
---
### Practical steps
Semaphore-based multi-threaded application `sync_sem`
```rust
pub fn main() -> i32 {
     // create semaphores
     assert_eq!(semaphore_create(0) as usize, SEM_SYNC);
     // create threads
     let threads = vec![
         thread_create(first as usize, 0),
         thread_create(second as usize, 0),
     ];
     // wait for all threads to complete
     for thread in threads. iter() {
         waittid(*thread as usize);
     }
...
```

---
### Practical steps
Semaphore-based multi-threaded application `sync_sem`
```rust
unsafe fn first() -> ! {
     sleep(10);
     println!("First work and wakeup Second");
     semaphore_up(SEM_SYNC);
     exit(0)
}
unsafe fn second() -> ! {
     println!("Second want to continue, but need to wait first");
     semaphore_down(SEM_SYNC);
     println!("Second can work now");
     exit(0)
}
```

---
### Practical steps
Semaphore-based multi-threaded application `sync_sem`
```
>> sync_sem
Second want to continue, but need to wait first
First work and wakeup Second
Second can work now
sync_sem passed!
```
- The initial value of the semaphore is set to 0
- semaphore_down() : The thread will suspend/block (suspend/block)
- semaphore_up(): will wake up the suspended thread

---
###  Programming
The core data structure of semaphore
```rust
pub struct Semaphore {
     pub inner: UPSafeCell<SemaphoreInner>, //The internal variable structure wrapped by UPSafeCell
}

pub struct SemaphoreInner {
     pub count: isize, //count value of semaphore
     pub wait_queue: VecDeque<Arc<TaskControlBlock>>, //Waiting queue for semaphore
}
```

---
###  Programming
Related functions of semaphore
```rust
     pub fn down(&self) {
         let mut inner = self. inner. exclusive_access();
         inner.count -= 1; //The count value of the semaphore is reduced by one
         if inner.count < 0 {
             inner.wait_queue.push_back(current_task().unwrap()); //put into the waiting queue
             drop(inner);
             //Take the current thread out of the ready queue, set it to a blocked state, and switch to another ready thread for execution
             block_current_and_run_next();
         }
     }
```

### Practical steps
Multi-threaded application `test_condvar` based on mutex and condition variable
```rust
pub fn main() -> i32 {
     // create condvar & mutex
     assert_eq!(condvar_create() as usize, CONDVAR_ID);
     assert_eq!(mutex_blocking_create() as usize, MUTEX_ID);
     // create threads
     let threads = vec![ thread_create(first as usize, 0),
                         thread_create(second as usize, 0),];
     // wait for all threads to complete
     for thread in threads. iter() {
         waittid(*thread as usize);
     }
     ...
```

---
### Practical steps
Multi-threaded application `test_condvar` based on mutex and condition variable
```rust
unsafe fn second() -> ! {
     println!("Second want to continue, but need to wait A=1");
     mutex_lock(MUTEX_ID);
     while A == 0 {
         println!("Second: A is {}", A);
         condvar_wait(CONDVAR_ID, MUTEX_ID);
     }
     mutex_unlock(MUTEX_ID);
     println!("A is {}, Second can work now", A);
     exit(0)
}
```

---
### Practical steps
Multi-threaded application `test_condvar` based on mutex and condition variable
```rust
unsafe fn first() -> ! {
     sleep(10);
     println!("First work, Change A --> 1 and wakeup Second");
     mutex_lock(MUTEX_ID);
     A = 1;
     condvar_signal(CONDVAR_ID);
     mutex_unlock(MUTEX_ID);
     exit(0)
}
```

---
### Practical steps
Multi-threaded application `test_condvar` based on mutex and condition variable
```
>> test_condvar
Second: A is 0
First work, Change A --> 1 and wakeup Second
A is 1, Second can work now
```
- `second` is executed first, but because `A==0`, it waits on the condition variable
- Execute after `first`, but before `second`, and wake up `second` through the condition variable

---
###  Programming
The core data structure of condvar
```rust
pub struct Condvar {
     pub inner: UPSafeCell<CondvarInner>, //The internal variable structure wrapped by UPSafeCell
}

pub struct CondvarInner {
     pub wait_queue: VecDeque<Arc<TaskControlBlock>>, //wait for queue
}
```

---
###  Programming
Related functions of condvar
```rust
     pub fn wait(&self, mutex: Arc<dyn Mutex>) {
         mutex.unlock(); //release the lock
         let mut inner = self. inner. exclusive_access();
         inner.wait_queue.push_back(current_task().unwrap()); //put into the waiting queue
         drop(inner);
         //Take the current thread out of the ready queue, set it to a blocked state, and switch to another ready thread for execution
         block_current_and_run_next();
         mutex. lock();
     }
```

---
###  Programming
Related functions of condvar
```rust
     pub fn signal(&self) {
         let mut inner = self. inner. exclusive_access();
         //Take the thread from the waiting queue and put it into the ready queue
         if let Some(task) = inner.wait_queue.pop_front() {
             add_task(task);
         }
     }
```

---
###  Programming
The design and implementation of sleep
```rust
pub fn sys_sleep(ms: usize) -> isize {
     let expire_ms = get_time_ms() + ms;
     let task = current_task().unwrap();
     add_timer(expire_ms, task);
     block_current_and_run_next();
     0
}
```
