  - :) Instead develop system programs

### data structure
  - :) Just understand the basic data structure

---

## Preliminary knowledge
### Principles of computer composition
  - :( Mr. Liu/Mr. Kang's RISC-V principle
  - :) Patterson's RISC-V Principles

### Compilation principle
  - :) It doesn't affect much if you haven't learned it
  - :( But still learn high level language <â€“>RISC-V assembly language

## Curriculum Design (Big Experiment)

### Various operating system related functions and extensions

- OS porting on various CPU platforms
   * RISC-V, x86-64, MIPS, ARM
- Driver development for various development boards
   * RaspBerry PI, U740, D1, etc.
   * GUI, driver, file system, network
- Perfection and improvement of the operating system kernel module
   * Kernel loadable modules, microkernels
   * Introduce asynchronous programming in the kernel

## grade evaluation

### Select 1:
   - Complete experiment 1 to experiment 5 on time: 30%
   - Midterm Exam 30% + Final Exam 40% : 70%
### Choice 2:
   - Complete experiment 1 to experiment 5 within four weeks (2022 spring experiment): 30%
   - Curriculum Design (i.e. Big Experiment): 70%
     - Note: Students who choose the big experiment need to take the exam if they quit the course design later.
