## Simple structure
MS-DOS: Application and OS mixed together (1981â€“1994)
- **Not split into modules**
- Written primarily in assembly
- No security

## Monomer Hierarchy
Divide the Monolithic OS into **multi-layers** (levels)
- Each layer builds on top of the lower
- The bottom layer (layer 0), is the hardware driver
- The highest layer (layer N) is the user interface
- Each layer uses only the functions and services of the lower layer

## Micro Kernel Structure (Micro Kernel)
- **Move kernel functions to user space as much as possible**
- Communication between user modules uses message passing
- Benefits: flexible/safe...
- Cons: performance
- LPC: Local Procedure Call (Local Procedure Call)
- HAL: Hardware Abstraction Layer (Hardware Abstraction Layer)

## Exokernel
- Let the kernel allocate physical resources to multiple applications, and let each program decide what to do with those resources
- Programs can link to the operating system library (libOS) which implements the operating system abstraction
- **Separation of protection and control**
- Distributed Shared Memory(DSM)

## Virtual machine structure
The virtual machine manager converts a single machine interface into many virtual machines, each virtual machine is an effective copy of the original computer system and can execute all processor instructions
